PEDIGREE PARSER
================

A small tool for parsing files in the pedigree (.ped) format.
The parser will create a family object for each family found in the pedigree file and a individual object for each individual found.
Moreover the parser will check that the family bindings are consistent and that all mandatory values exist and have correct values.
